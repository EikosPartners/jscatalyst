> An open source Vue component toolkit to quickly build realtime dashboards and allow for instant sharing of dashboards and charts

## What is JS Catalyst for?
JS Catalyst was built to allow both designers and developers to create feature-rich and sleek dashboards. By creating charting components that accept flexible data it is easy to just drop a component in on any page and feed it the data.

## Install
- **yarn**: ` yarn add jscatalyst `
- **npm**: ` npm install jscatalyst`

To use it directly in the browser please use the unpkg link. This will automatically load in the jscatalst.min.js file.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jscatalyst"></script>
```
